# Shopping List

A simple and straightforward shopping list app with smartwatch support. Swipe between the categories and click on the products to add them to the list. You can prepare your list at home so you don't forget anything. Once in the shop, click on the products on the list to mark them as already in the cart. When you close the app, all the products that were in the cart will be removed from the list automatically. You can also create, edit and delete your own products and categories to adapt the app your your needs. To access to more options on an item, just perform a long press on it and a context menu will appear. The app comes with an Android wear version for your smartwatch. You don't need to hold your phone in your hand, the list will appear on your watch!
